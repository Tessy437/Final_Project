# Final_Project
The code backup is given in two separate folders.
In the "Models" directory, there are three Colab notebook files that show the creation and training of three separate models whereas the "Interface" folder holds files in the Jupyter notebook used in the designing of the interface of the prototype system.

Primary Research folder contains the pdf version of the online questionnaire survey created using the Online Bristol tool and Proposal folder contains the submitted proposal for the project.
